Topic: The goal of the semester project is to implement the board game Arimaa in the Java programming language.

Game Mechanism: Implementation of the rules of Arimaa, including the movement of pieces and special abilities. Support for player moves, validation of their correctness, and the implementation of a game clock to track the time spent thinking by each player.

Artificial Intelligence: Creation of an algorithm for artificial intelligence capable of playing the game Arimaa against the player, with a generator of 1 to 4 random legal moves.

Saving Game States: Ability to save and load ongoing games, and the option to step back through the game move by move.

Multiplayer Mode: Implementation of the option for two players to play against each other on the same computer.
