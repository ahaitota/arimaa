Arimaa Game Implementation in Java

This project is a full implementation of the board game Arimaa, developed as a semester project. The game offers a user-friendly interface, AI gameplay, and multiplayer support, bringing all the strategic depth of Arimaa to life in the Java programming language.

Features
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Players can interact with the game seamlessly via an intuitive and responsive graphical interface.
The game board and the current state of play are rendered clearly for a smooth user experience.
All user inputs are captured effectively, making it easy to move pieces and navigate through the game.

2. Game Mechanics
The project adheres to all the official rules of Arimaa, including:
Piece Movement: Correct movement of all six types of pieces (Rabbit, Cat, Dog, Horse, Camel, Elephant).
Special Abilities: Implemented key mechanics like pushing, pulling, and freezing of pieces.
Player Turns: Validation of each move to ensure that it follows the gameâ€™s rules.
Game Clock: A turn-based timer that tracks how long each player spends thinking, with built-in time limits.

3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The AI component is designed to offer a challenging opponent for solo play:
The AI generates between 1 to 4 random valid moves, ensuring variability in gameplay.
It reacts to player strategies in real time, providing a dynamic and competitive experience.

4. Save & Load Game States
Players can save their current game and resume later, with support for:
Save & Load: Save game progress at any point and load it when needed.
Move-by-Move Review: Step back through previous moves to analyze strategies and learn from past decisions.

5. Multiplayer Mode
The game includes a two-player mode, allowing both players to compete on the same computer.
The interface smoothly handles input from both players, ensuring a fair and enjoyable experience.
